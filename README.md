# Simpai Static Page Generator

Simpai is the simple Python static page generator. and it has noticed your need for a hand crafted, statically generated mark up -- but without the tedium of manual maintenance. With Simpai, you will write your HTML template once, format it to be read by Simpai, and it will take care of every page afterwards that you will ever need.

### DEPRECATED: 

I scrapped the original simpai-spg, which you can find in the `/old-version/` directory. At one time it worked in a less complicated form, although I'm not sure if it still works. This deprecated directory is a testament to what this started out as. Very simple. My first bigger project attempt. I learned a lot from trying to do it, but by no means should you use this.
